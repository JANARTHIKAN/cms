JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
MongoDB Atlas account and cluster set up.
Basic understanding of React and MongoDB.
Installation
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contact-management.git
cd contact-management
2. Setup the Backend
Navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory to store your MongoDB Atlas connection URI and other secrets:

plaintext
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the Express server on port 5000 by default.

3. Setup the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

MongoDB Atlas Setup
Create a MongoDB Atlas account and create a new cluster.
Go to Network Access and whitelist your IP address (or add 0.0.0.0/0 for testing).
Create a new database in your MongoDB Atlas cluster and get the connection string (format: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority).
Replace the <username>, <password>, and <dbname> in the .env file in the backend directory with your MongoDB Atlas details.
